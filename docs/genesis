A standard and highly recommended approach for setting up a GitHub repository, especially when including documentation or static HTML pages, is to use a `docs` directory and leverage GitHub Pages.

Here is the suggested file structure and a brief explanation of each component, which you can use as a guide for your `project-engine` repository.

project-engine/
├── .github/              # Stores configuration for GitHub features like issue templates.
│   └── ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md
├── docs/                 # This is the core folder for your documentation.
│   ├── index.html        # Main entry point for your documentation site (e.g., Read Me intro).
│   ├── business-comparison.html  # Dedicated page for "Scale Up Long Term Business Comparison."
│   ├── ops-screen-design.html    # Dedicated page for "Ops Screen Design Landing Page."
│   ├── css/              # Optional: Directory for all CSS files to style your HTML pages.
│   └── images/           # Optional: Directory for images, diagrams, and other assets.
└── README.md             # The main landing page for the repository itself on GitHub.

Your pages will then be live at a URL like `https://innov8tor3.github.io/project-engine/`. The `index.html` file will be the default page, and your other files will be accessible at their respective paths (e.g., `https://innov8tor3.github.io/project-engine/business-comparison.html`).

A peculiarity about GitHub is that folder creation takes place as new non null files are added and committed.
