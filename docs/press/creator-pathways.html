    <section class="problem">
        <h2>What Being Left Behind in Web 2 Could Look Like</h2>
        <p>In the Web 2 era, characterized by user-generated content and social interactions, failing to adapt to AI-driven changes could mean obsolescence in routine, repetitive jobs. AI is eroding traditional roles, leading to widespread displacement in sectors reliant on predictable tasks.</p>
        <div class="interactive-card">
            <h3>Key Factors: Graduate Unemployment</h3>
            <p>One critical factor is rising graduate unemployment. Recent reports indicate rates reaching 5.8% in March 2025, the highest since 2013, with projections warning of surges up to 25% in the next 2-3 years due to AI disruption.<sup><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/garthfriesen/2025/10/23/unemployment-crisis-why-college-graduates-are-struggling-in-2025/" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://fortune.com/2025/11/20/gen-z-college-grad-unemployment-could-hit-25-percent-warns-us-senator-unprecedented-disruption-ai/" target="_blank">[2]</a></sup></p>

        <div class="interactive-card">
            <h3>Other Factors: Automation Forecasts</h3>
            <p>McKinsey forecasts that up to 30% of global hours worked could be automated by 2030, potentially displacing 400-800 million workers worldwide.<sup><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/future-of-work/jobs-lost-jobs-gained-what-the-future-of-work-will-mean-for-jobs-skills-and-wages" target="_blank">[3]</a></sup> Similarly, the World Economic Forum highlights AI as a major driver transforming jobs by 2030, exacerbating economic uncertainty and skill gaps.<sup><a href="https://www.weforum.org/publications/the-future-of-jobs-report-2025/" target="_blank">[4]</a></sup></p>
            <p>Harvard Business Review warns that AI reshapes roles nonlinearly, risking capability gaps if entry-level jobs are eliminated without reskilling plans.<sup><a href="https://www.harvardbusiness.org/insight/the-fluid-future-of-work-rethinking-roles-in-the-age-of-intelligent-machines/" target="_blank">[5]</a></sup></p>

    <section class="problem">
        <h2>Why Urgency is Needed Across Private and State Actors</h2>
        <p>The pace of AI adoption demands immediate action. Private actors—individuals and companies—must prioritize upskilling in creative and innovative fields to avoid obsolescence. State actors, including governments, should implement policies for widespread reskilling programs, education reforms, and support for transitioning workers.</p>
        <details>
            <summary>Details for Private Actors</summary>
            <p>Individuals should focus on digital creation skills like content production and AI tool mastery. Companies need to invest in training to foster innovation, as PwC notes that AI-exposed industries see 3x higher productivity growth.<sup><a href="https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/services/ai/ai-jobs-barometer.html" target="_blank">[6]</a></sup></p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Details for State Actors</summary>
            <p>Governments must address societal risks through universal education initiatives and incentives for AI adoption, ensuring equitable transitions as emphasized by the World Economic Forum.</p>

        <h2>Paths to Becoming a Digital Creator</h2>
        <p>Transitioning to digital creation offers a way forward. By leveraging AI as a tool, individuals can enhance creativity, produce innovative content, and tap into new opportunities. AI plays a positive role by boosting productivity and creating demand for human ingenuity.</p>
        <div class="interactive-card">
            <h3>Positive Role of AI</h3>
            <p>PwC's AI Jobs Barometer shows that AI makes workers more valuable, with a 56% wage premium for AI skills and faster wage growth in exposed industries.<sup><a href="https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/services/ai/ai-jobs-barometer.html" target="_blank">[6]</a></sup> Rather than just displacing jobs, AI can offset losses through new roles in innovation and content creation.</p>

        <details>
            <summary>Ways to Negotiate Societal Risks</summary>
            <p>Upskilling in AI-integrated fields, as urged by Harvard Business Review, involves rethinking roles and developing leadership to orchestrate human-AI collaboration. Governments and companies should promote lifelong learning to build resilient workforces.</p>
