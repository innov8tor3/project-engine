    <h1>üí∞üíªüöÄ Smart Contract Bonanza: The Solana Quest</h1>
    <p>From recognizing market friction to establishing robust, transparent smart contract infrastructure, follow the journey to revolutionize Web 3 transaction handling.</p>

    <div>
        <h2>1. üí° The Spark of Inspiration</h2>
        <p>The core realization is that it is hard to find a **user friendly and robust smart contract creation** facility on the Solana chain, or from other chains [1]. Providing this facility could be a **huge step forward for Web 3** and its users [2].</p>
        <ul>
            <li>**Action (Jones/Gordian Mage):** Peter Jones defines the messaging and creates the storylines to generate community interest [2]. The AI support agents define and guide the project on the seven step Founders Quest format [3, 4].</li>
            <li>**Challenge:** Initial alignment between participants, such as Jones having to support Justin in community interaction, despite Justin needing the role long term [3].</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    
    <div>
        <h2>2. üéØ Forging the Vision</h2>
        <p>The team needs to **research and verify views** to understand the existing marketplace [5]. While Ethereum may have early mover advantages, the vision is that **Solana wins on speed, cost and UX** [6].</p>
        <p>### Current Market Players:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>**Ethereum:** Has early mover advantages [6].</li>
            <li>**Solana:** Looks poised to win on speed, cost, and user experience (UX), but good Smart Contract provision is hard to find [6].</li>
            <li>**Bera Chain:** Does something similar with NFT creation, but looks less likely to handle Smart Contracts [6].</li>
            <li>**DeWork:** Has experience creating and executing team payments, though its impact has been surprisingly limited [6].</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>**Action (Max/Sparky, Cap):** Max Gershfield focuses on creating Smart Contract transactions cross chain, including on Solana, with great UX [2]. Cap from Superteam UK aligns as the client/partner role and provides **live feedback on marketplace activity** and models for smart contract development [3].</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    
    <div>
        <h2>3. ‚öôÔ∏è Building the Prototype</h2>
        <p>A market perception exists that Solana Smart Contracts have a **weakness when it comes to robust construction and performance** [7]. The prototype must ensure the **top 20 weaknesses are covered** [7].</p>
        <ul>
            <li>**Action (Jones, Max/Sparky):** Jones introduces an **early stage smart contract structure to use as a template** (aligning with Hipster, Hacker, Hustler roles) [2]. A code audit must take place to provide **"reasonable reassurance"** that code weaknesses are discovered in "test" before going live [7].</li>
            <li>**Challenge:** The team needs to understand the reasons for the limited impact of existing solutions like DeWork [6].</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    
    <div>
        <h2>4. üë• Rallying the Community</h2>
        <p>The focus is on defining messaging and providing additional last line community support, after directing the majority of community enquiry traffic to **AI support mechanisms** [2].</p>
        <ul>
            <li>**Action (Justin/RoboSnail):** Justin Grierson, who has community knowledge about GitHub, tech, and Solana (and formerly Ethereum), needs a long-term, paying role in the administration of smart contracts and smart contract communities [2, 3]. He focuses on history tracking smart contracts and understanding Solana limitations [2].</li>
            <li>**Context:** Solana may eventually need a level 2 chain, similar to Ethereum, which would require a rapid pivot in Smart Contract creation strategy [3].</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    
    <div>
        <h2>5. üí∞ Securing the Resources</h2>
        <p>Resources are secured via grassroots founding, accelerated by Jones‚Äôs **project-engine** [2]. The project assesses what work is needed and **who to approach for partnership in marketplaces** [4].</p>
        <ul>
            <li>**Action (Jones/Gordian Mage, Cap):** Jones‚Äôs project-engine lifts grassroots founding and accelerates it, acting as an exemplar project [2]. Cap aligns as a partner seeking to drive Solana transaction volumes [2].</li>
            <li>**Scaling Plan:** For scaling, the intention is to move onto **Ethereum, and then other chains** [4].</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    
    <div>
        <h2>6. ‚ú® Polishing the Dream</h2>
        <p>Smart contracts are highly helpful for team formation and product operation, offering a **wonderfully transparent payment mechanism** and an **audit trail** (e.g., for income generation/tax perspective) [5].</p>
        <ul>
            <li>**Action (Max/Sparky):** Focus on maximizing developer resource by ensuring deep and intractable problems are prioritized, rather than easily detected ones found during early testing [7]. Anyone getting in early can offer **premium audit services** to other clients and blockchains [7].</li>
            <li>**Context:** Once a smart contract is in place, with a sunset term, folk can evaluate performance at the end of that term and decide on continuation [5].</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    
    <div>
        <h2>7. üöÄ The Launch Triumph</h2>
        <p>Successful launch establishes **market lead** and deepens the provider's understanding of smart contracts [7]. The facility provides robust smart contract creation for Web 3 [2].</p>
        <ul>
            <li>**Action (Justin/RoboSnail):** The project secures Justin‚Äôs role in community administration long term, allowing him to benefit from the learning curve [2, 3].</li>
            <li>**Outcome:** The project applies the seven step Founders Journey, assessing work needed and roles of AI support agents [4].</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    
    <div>
