        <h1>The Libi Game Dev Democratization Quest</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">From antiquated coding to real-time storytelling magic. Follow the journey of a visionary founder revolutionizing game development with WYSIWYG tools, AI assistance, and community empowerment in the $189B global games market of 2025.</p>

        <section>
            <h2><span class="emoji">üí°</span> The Spark of Inspiration</h2>
            <p>The Founder, a passionate storyteller frustrated by the slow, technical batch-load processes of traditional game dev, dreams of a WYSIWYG platform where changes appear in real-time. Libi emerges as the tool to democratize creation, letting anyone drop in scenery, characters, and artifacts without deep coding knowledge.</p>
            <p>Gordian Mage guides brainstorming with AI to align Libi with market trends, like the rise of user-generated content in games. Lab Assistant Sparky sets up a prototype repo on GitHub. Sergeant Robo Snail connects to indie forums on Reddit and itch.io for early validation.</p>
            <p>Reality check: In a saturated $189B market, can a solo disruptor challenge incumbents? Protect IP early and ensure the idea sparks genuine community interest.</p>

            <h2><span class="emoji">üéØ</span> Forging the Vision</h2>
            <p>The Founder refines Libi into a real-time editor for 2D/3D games, targeting Tier 2 studios hungry to challenge Tier 1 giants. Drawing parallels to AI's democratization of visuals, Libi shifts focus from code to storytelling.</p>
            <p>Gordian Mage analyzes SteamDB and Newzoo data for niches like mobile and VR. Sparky experiments with Stable Diffusion for instant asset generation. Robo Snail eyes grants from Epic MegaGrants, crafting a pitch on cost reductions (up to 70% faster dev cycles).</p>
            <p>Notes: AI assets need cohesion tweaks. Start small in Western markets before Asia's 50% share via WeChat integration.</p>

            <p>The Founder prototypes core WYSIWYG mechanics in Unity, where drag-and-drop updates render instantly. Sparky uses GitHub Copilot to accelerate scripting for procedural elements.</p>
            <p>Gordian Mage ensures alignment with player retention via real-time testing loops. Robo Snail recruits alpha testers from Discord, gathering feedback on usability for non-devs.</p>
            <p>Challenges: Initial bugs in real-time syncing delay iterations, but projections show a surge in storytellers (10x more designers from player base).</p>

            <h2><span class="emoji">üí∞</span> Securing the Resources</h2>
            <p>With seed funding in hand, the Founder commits to democratization, rejecting models that dilute ethos. Wins a $15K Epic Grant via Gordian Mage's pitch on seismic shifts like iPhone's UX revolution.</p>
            <p>Sparky upgrades to premium tools for multiplayer collab features. Robo Snail negotiates partnerships with Tier 2 studios, retaining control √† la WhatsApp's path to Meta.</p>
            <p>Considerations: Self-publishing saves equity but slows speed; collect pre-launch emails via Steam page.</p>
